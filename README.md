# Mosh with SRV records

Wrapper around [mosh](https://mosh.org) (and eventually ssh) to use SRV records for:
- standard port setup,
- trying various IPs in a controlled order

# TODO

- [ ] Get port and host from SRV record
- [ ] Read a set of paramters from a configuration file
- [ ] Support SSH as well
